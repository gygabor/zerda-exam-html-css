## 2. Understand code (~15 minutes) [2 points]



Read the following code snippet:   
What is the distance between the top-left corner of the document body and the yellow box?   
Give a detailed explanation below!   
Add your answer to this readme file, commit your changes to this repository.

Answer:

The distance between the yellow box and the top-left corner of the body is from top: 40px, from left: 40px.

The yellow box is a child of the blue box. Both positions are absolute. The parent's absolute position resets the earlier positions. Therefore the yellow box positioned in the blue box (blue box top: 20px, left:20px). The blue box positioned in the body (body top: 20px left: 20px). The two boxes positions added and the result is: top: 40px left: 40px between the body top/left corner and the yellow box top-left corner.


```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      body {
        padding: 0px;
        margin: 0px;
      }
      .foo {
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        position: absolute;
        background: blue;
      }
      .bar {
        top: 20px;
        left: 20px;
        width: 30px;
        height: 30px;
        position: absolute;
        background: yellow;
      }
    </style>
